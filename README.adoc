This repository hosts an {url-antora}[Antora] playbook project for the Hazelcast documentation site.

== Work in progress

The roadmap for this site includes the following items:

- [ ] Migrate Hazelcast Cloud content
- [ ] Migrate Jet content
- [ ] Migrate Management Center content
- [ ] Review and restructure content, starting with IMDG

== Introduction to Antora

Antora is a static site generator that facilitates a docs-as-code workflow where documentation is stored in Git repositories and processed to output a static website.

Documentation can be stored in one or more repositories and/or branches.

Antora uses Asciidoctor.js to convert Asciidoc to HTML, then it uses Handlebars to set that HTML into a page layout.

<<<<<<< HEAD
NOTE: The page layouts and UI code (css, JavaScript, Handlebars templates) is stored in a {url-docs-ui}[separate repository], which outputs a `ui-bundle.zip` file that this project references in the playbook.

== The playbook

The playbook defines the content sources (repositories and branches), site URL, UI bundle URL, global AsciiDoc attributes, and Asciidoctor extensions.

This project has two playbook files, which configure the build process for the documentation site:

- `antora-playbook-local.yml`: link:{url-contributing}#local-builds[For local builds]
- `antora-playbook.yml`: For production builds

The current playbooks pull from the following content sources:

- The `master`, `archive`, and all `v` branches of the{url-imdg-docs}[`hazelcast-reference-manual` repository]
- The `home/` folder in this repository, which contains an Antora component for the home page

[[home]]
== Home Component

The `home/` folder in this repository contains the source for the Home documentation component with links to all major documentation projects.

== Custom Asciidoctor Extensions
The custom extension in the `lib/` directory processes the Asciidoc `tabs` blocks to generate tabbed code samples in the output HTML.

For more information about writing Asciidoctor.js extensions, see the {url-asciidoc-extensions}[Asciidoctor docs].

== GitHub Actions

To automate some elements of the build process, this repository includes the following GitHub Actions:
